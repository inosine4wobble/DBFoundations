'NOTES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 1) You can use any name you like for you views, but be descriptive and consistent
 2) You can use your working code from assignment 5 for much of this assignment
 3) You must use the BASIC views for each table after they are created in Question 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'

-- Question 1 (5% pts): How can you create BASIC views to show data from each table in the database.
-- NOTES: 1) Do not use a *, list out each column!
--        2) Create one view per table!
--		  3) Use SchemaBinding to protect the views from being orphaned!

-- Question 2 (5% pts): How can you set permissions, so that the public group CANNOT select data 
-- from each table, but can select data from each view?

DENY  SELECT ON Categories TO Public;
GRANT SELECT ON vCategories TO Public;

-- and the Employee that took the count?
-- Order the results by the Date and return only one row per date!

-- Here is are the rows selected from the view:
